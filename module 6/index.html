	<p> 	&emsp;&emsp;Have you ever wanted to get in on this "crypto" thing? I mean it sounds pretty exciting, and with 
		the price of things like bitcoin and NFTs, you could make a killing off of getting in early. But once you do
		some research, you realize that making a profit would require buying a massive mining farm, an industrial
		warehouse, and a degree in computer science to make a profit. You don't have that kind of time, no one does.
		If only there was a better way...
