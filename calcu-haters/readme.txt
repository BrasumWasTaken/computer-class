Unfortunately, I couldn't get a lot of what I wanted done. This is mostly due to an attempt to change languages for 
better performance mid-project, from Python to C#, which I have FAR less experience in, which ate up a lot more
time than I had hoped it would. In the end, I decided to scrap the C# build and just finish up on the Python code.
That said however, there is still some stuff that made the cut, namely the profile system. I managed to get the 
framework implimented, however it lacks a way to modify it outside just opening the file in Notepad, but I still
consider that half points.
